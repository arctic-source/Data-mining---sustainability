# Data mining - sustainability

This is a personal project dedicated to data mining. I decided to select a project in a domain that interests me to learn more about the domain - which is sustainability. At the same time, the project allows me to practice work with complex, real-world datasets and machine learning.

-----------------
## Project structure

0. Data mining
1. Research questions
2. Data sources
3. Prerequisities
4. Project notebooks
---------------
## Tools used
In the project, I will use Python to process and model data, along with common data science libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, statsmodels and jupyter notebook.

------------------
## 0 - Data mining
**Definition: Data mining is "the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data"** [[Kriegel, 2007]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-007-0067-9).

I find this an important skill for the age I live in. I think an ability to extract and identify trends and patterns in data can be a useful skill and can provide one with important information for decision making. A data mining project should also have an aim since just looking through data does not neccessarily generate useful information about patterns in the data. Also, the identification of useful information or patterns is required from definition. Therefore, I will formulate some domain-ispecific data mining research questions, even though I do not have much formal knowledge in this aspect yet.

------------------
## 1 - Research questions
Here are some initial research questions that I will aim to answer a beginner in the domain:

**1. In the present, which countries are the biggest CO2 producers on the planet? And which are the biggest CO2 producers per capita?  
2. Can we build a machine learning model to predict the amount of CO2 that is generated by a country, given other data about the country?  
3. Analyze the time series of yearly CO2 production that is being generated by the 5 biggest producers of CO2 in the world. What can we learn from this analysis?**

------------------
## 2 - Data sources
To answer the questions, a suitable data source is needed. For this cause, I selected the [The World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-development-goals-(sdgs)). The bank includes a dataset named "Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)" which I identified as containing relevant features. I will refer to this dataset as the **SDG dataset**. Next, I selected a few options for data export - I selected all countries available and all features available. The dataset includes a high number of features ranging from education (literacy rate, primary education completion rate), economy (GDP, exports, unemployment, foreign investments, taxes) to environment (species threatened, CO2 emissions). Next, I specified I want to download this information about the following time range: 2010-2020 (to answer the first question) and 1990-2020 (to answer the third question). Here is the UI for data selection:

I also use another dataset as a supplement to the main SDG dataset mentioned in answering the first question. The supplementary dataset is the
"Population Estimates and Projections" (https://databank.worldbank.org/source/population-estimates-and-projections).  

------------------
## 3 - Prerequisities
I should mention that I am using Python 3.11 on my local machine (Windows 10) with a virtual environment that includes some of the typical data science libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- statsmodels  
- openpyxl - to work with MS Excel files with .xlsx suffix

------------------
## 4 - Project notebooks
Next, the project is branched into separate jupyter notebooks depending on the research question for transparency. Feel free to click on the research question of interest to explore the relevant jupyter notebook.
